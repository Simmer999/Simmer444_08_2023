Goal: to Dramatically simplify my website. I want to include only a gallery and a list of articles.
- I will use 'blush media' as the landing page.
- From there the website will go in two directions.
- The first direction will feature the writing that I am working on.
- The second will feature the box projects that I have completed.
- A third but hidden direction will feature the Inglewood data that already is there.

- One design idea is to have a scroll with a background that becomes lighter as one scrolls down.
- I'd like to invert every second plume of smoke.
- I'm thinking of removing the slide action.
