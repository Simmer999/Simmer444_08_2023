        The moral code derived from scripture is an admixture of two sensibilities.The emotional reactions that are experienced when confronted with infractions of various kinds are different for different infractions. For most injunctions the root is a sense of injustice and the alleviation of the fear. For some the injunction is against a sense of disgust.
        It is interesting that a moral code is built around more than one emotional reaction but not be explicit about that fact. The reasons why there is no explicit distinction may prove to be informative. The reasons why may shed light on why there is debate now over the validity of some biblical injunctions and not others. It's strange but for some people there  is no difference between injustice and disgust. Are these people just unable to tell the difference or are the two concepts/feelings so intertwined  that they ought to be treated as the same thing? 
        So, let's retreat here and examine briefly why a moral code should be devised in the first place.It seems to me from the example of Moses' law that the concern was for  relationships between individuals to be smooth and respectful( there may be better words here). Some laws were instituted to enforce a respect for the persons and items in the proximity of another person. Theis formed the basis of a common definition if belonging to or of property, And to an extent the conception would include ones' safety although it might be argued that safety and the freedom from fear might constitute a third category of moral injunction.
        A second reason for developing commonly held morality would be the case of health and cleanliness. This is possibly related to safety but that distinction is for another time. The point here is that moral injunctions against theft, for example, have different grounds than that of handling a cadaver. The latter has to do with health and cleanliness and the reaction to infractions against norms of this kind is properly disgust whereas infractions against the former is properly anger. The issue becomes complicated when one reverses the logic and defines everything that one feels disgust for as somehow equally deserving of moral sanction.
        My point may be illustrated by comparing the unjust actions toward a person and doing the same injustice to a cadaver, what we call the desecration of a body. One reacts with anger towards the former and disgust with the latter. The difference between the two is that the latter is largely an aesthetic infraction.
        For this reason I believe that the traditional view expressed by the HSR is based on aesthetics and aesthetic taste and not on any sense of justice or injustice. It is based on feelings of a sense of cleanliness not safety.
        Not only should the HSR, and its defense of a traditional deontological moral structure, be questioned as desperately needing an update. From the position that a moral code is a social construct and not just a fiat declaration, the HSR position though well defended biblically is not defensible creationally. Now we have a second argument criticizing the traditional position on homosexuality for its reliance on homosexuality generating the same aesthetic reactions of disgust that are generated from infractions against health codes.
