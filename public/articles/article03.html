        <p id="article_heading">Some Considerations on Snippets of Moral Code</p>
        <br>

        It is interesting that a moral code is built around more than one emotional reaction but that this moral code is not explicit about that fact. Why there is no explicit distinction may prove to be informative. The reasons why may shed light on why there is debate nowadays over the validity of some biblical injunctions but not others. In any case, this article will attempt to extend the logic regarding difference in emotional reaction to the two types of laws into the distinction between two types of value; moral value and aesthetic value. By steering the discussion in this direction, the idea is to understand why laws of cleanliness are no longer considered to be legally or even morally binding but yet still binding in some sense, namely, aesthetically. From this position the claim that the HSR is making (ie. that homosexual acts are immoral and, thus anathema to Christion living) will be undermined.
        The moral code derived from scripture is an admixture of two sensibilities: a sense of justice and a sense of cleanliness. The first of these is, without a doubt, well established with most of this group of laws having to do with reparations and punishments for specific offences against persons or their property. The second, although not frequently recognized, is clear from the common theme of proper procedures for ceremonial washing, food preparation, and priestly inspection regarding disease. The two groups combine to form a code that regulates behaviour both prohibitively and prescriptively. Thus, both injustice and contagion are minimised. 
        The minimising of injustice and contagion are designed to minimise fear in community and, thereby build trust, And, by building trust, the community can develop a single purpose in the face of outside threats. Therefore, if infractions of the stated laws occur, fear is raised. But the emotions attendant to the raising of fear differ from one infraction to another. For infractions having to do with harm to self or property one’s attendant emotion is anger. For infractions having to do with health and cleanliness one’s attendant emotion is disgust, the difference between the two being whether a perpetrator can be identified.
        Strangely, some see no difference between injustice and disgust. Are these people just unable to tell the difference or are the two concepts/feelings so intertwined that they ought to be treated as the same thing? Perhaps one contains the other. Certainly, one can be disgusted with injustice but feelings of injustice over disgusting things is a stretch. But this observation brings up a question concerning the types of things injustice and disgust are. Are they from one category? Is it even valid to compare the two? The sense of injustice has a much more cerebral feel to it. It’s almost academic. It’s certainly more objective when speaking about it generally. Disgust, on the other hand, has a definite guttural quality to it. Perhaps, then, the sense of injustice and the sense of disgust are reactions from different parts of the brain. Whatever the origins of each, it is obvious that the more cerebral sense of injustice is a construct based on social norms and not on physiological changes in the body.
    
    Background conception of moral code
    
    Perhaps at this point we can retreat and regroup a bit. We need to have a clear understanding of why a moral code would be devised in the first place. It seems from the example of Moses’ law that the concern was for relationships between individuals to be at least as harmonious as to produce more longevity to a greater majority of a tribe. Some laws were instituted to enforce a respect for the persons and items in the proximity of another person. This formed the basis of a common definition of belonging to or of property, And to an extent the conception would include ones’ safety although it might be argued that safety and the freedom from fear might constitute a third category of moral injunction.
    A second reason for developing commonly held morality (Be more explicit in what the first reason is.) would be the case of health and cleanliness. This is possibly related to safety but that distinction is for another time. The point here is that moral injunctions against theft, for example, have different grounds than that of handling a cadaver. The latter has to do with health and cleanliness and the reaction to infractions against norms of this kind is properly disgust whereas infractions against the former is properly anger. The issue becomes complicated when one reverses the logic and defines everything that one feels disgust for as somehow equally deserving of moral sanction.
    My point may be illustrated by comparing the unjust actions toward a person and doing the same injustice to a cadaver, what we call the desecration of a body. One reacts with anger towards the former and disgust with the latter. The difference between the two is that the latter is largely an aesthetic infraction. For this reason I believe that the traditional view expressed by the HSR is based on aesthetics and aesthetic taste and not on any sense of justice or injustice. It is based on feelings of a sense of cleanliness not safety.
        Not only should the HSR, and its defense of a traditional deontological moral structure, be questioned as desperately needing an update, the premise that homosexual behaviour is considered anathema is based not on moral grounds but, instead, on.aesthetic grounds. From the position that a moral code is a social construct and not just a fiat declaration, the HSR position though well defended biblically is not defensible creationally. The creator
