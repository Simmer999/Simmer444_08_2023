            In the most general sense, we are dealing with imperative statements in the bible. These are statements that bear the qualities of will, that is, the will of a power recognized by those over whom these imperative statements are intended to supervene. By implication, there are two parties in the relationship established by the issuance of this type of statement, first, the maker of the statements in question and, second, the party who is expected to comply with the statements. Furthermore, the issuance of a statement of this kind is intended to cause the behaviour of the second party to reflect the intention of the first party without a corresponding reciprocal behaviour modification in return. This is not quid pro quo but there is a state change. Before the issuance of an imperative the relationship between the two parties is ambiguous but, afterward, a clear power hierarchy is in place. With the issuance of a command comes the establishment of, and answer to, the question of who the powerful party is and who the powerless party is. And once this occurs the ball is the court of the second party, so to speak. The second party had the choice of either obeying the imperative or disobeying it. The two questions that arise are: “Are there consequences for either choice?” and, if so: “What are the consequences of either choice?”
            When we progress from the most general, we encounter a need to define at least some of the characteristics of the parties. So, one would think that the place to start would be to lay down some basic assumptions. First, let us presume the rule that ‘should’ implies ‘can’. If an edict is issued without this assumption, the arbitrariness of the edict would be evident and the edict would not be carried out. Second, in an ideal world where the first party is deemed to be good and the carrying out of the edict is to be deemed to be be in the best interest of the second party, obeying the imperative would have us assume that the first party, the powerful one, issues the imperative statement for the benefit of the powerless one. In other words, let us assume that the powerful party is benevolent. Moreover, let us assume that the powerful party has reasons for issuing the imperatives that it does, that it is not arbitrary in its will. Instead it recognizes the dangers that the imperative statements are designed to prevent while the second party does not recognize them. 
        Once we have these parameters laid out, then we can recognize that the moral code derived from scripture is an admixture of two sensibilities or two recognitions. The first recognition is that individuals have within themselves the propensity toward self-preservation and as such, to overtly extend that propensity at the expense of weaker individuals. Not only does this self-preservation come in the form of selfishness but it also exhibits itself in the form of predation. Commands are given to prevent this type of behaviour. The second recognition is that individuals are often given over to ignorance of the consequences of personal actions
