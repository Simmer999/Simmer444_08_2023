        Fear is a marvellous motivator. You can get people to do just about anything with it… so much so that, more than anything else, people fear fear. Because, the reduction to fear shows most clearly the pathetic state one is in. No one wants to live in fear.
        So, you make rules against it, right? 
        Tough to do. Can you really make rules against being afraid?
        You can only make rules against things that cause fear. Wouldn't you agree? 
        Specifically, you can only make rules against actions that cause fear. Correct? And so we make up a set of rules that 'rule out' certain actions, negative rules that prohibit actions… actions that cause fear, legal rules for the big ones and moral rules for the little ones. We have rules because less fear is good.
        Ok. So, what happens when a rule is broken? Well, for sure, the victim of the  broken rule might feel fear, especially when there is violence involved. But what about all those around? They wouldn't feel fear so much as anger that they would feel fear… if they were the victim. So… generally speaking, broken rules cause mostly anger.

        Disgust


        It is interesting that a moral code is built around more than one emotional reaction. It is also interesting that this moral code is not explicit about that fact. Why there is no explicit distinction may prove to be informative. The reasons why may shed light on why there is debate nowadays over the validity of some biblical injunctions but not others. 
        This article will attempt to extend the logic regarding difference in emotional reaction to the two types of laws into the distinction between two types of value; moral value and aesthetic value. By steering the discussion in this direction, the idea is to understand why laws of cleanliness are no longer considered to be legally or even morally binding but yet still binding in an aesthetic sense. From this position the claim that the HSR is making (ie. that homosexual acts are immoral and, thus anathema to Christion living) will be questioned.
        We need to have a clearer understanding of why a moral code would be devised in the first place. From Pojman (2000) we get that instituting a moral code has five purposes, namely: "to keep society from falling apart", "to ameliorate human suffering", "to promote human flourishing", "to resolve conflicts of interest in just and orderly ways", and "to assign praise and blame, reward the good and punish the guilty''. But from Quine (1979) we get a more primordial response. This paper will follow Qiune's lead and follow up with an assumption of a social contract argument based on it in order to set up this premise.

        First Premise: Background conception of moral code

        From Pojman's perspective, the example of the Mosaic law shows that the concern was for relationships between individuals to be at least as harmonious as to produce more longevity to a greater majority of a tribe. Some laws were instituted to prohibit violence, enforcing a respect for other persons. And some laws were made to protect property, at least items in the proximity of another person, and thereby ensuring the stability of sorts. Thus, the first reason for the appearance of laws, as a proxy for a moral code, is for social stability and security from acts by others.
        A second reason for developing commonly held morality would be the case of health and cleanliness. This is possibly related to safety but that distinction here is that the perpetrator, in this case, is a third party and that the offence is in failing to take measures to prevent its distribution. The point here is that moral injunctions against theft, for example, have different grounds than that of handling unclean things. The latter has to do with health and cleanliness and the reaction to infractions against norms of this kind is more likely to be disgust whereas infractions against the former is more likely to be anger. 
        The issue is not that these two reasons for a moral code are somehow invalid but when one reverses the logic and defines everything that one feels disgust for or anger for as somehow equally deserving of moral sanction. (I believe that I have weakened my argument by recognising that not all angering acts are to be assigned moral sanction either.

        Second Premise: some disgusting are not immoral

        There are examples of acts that induce anger and disgust but are not morally sanctionable. So, the fact that some people confuse and mix up the two is beside the point. What is important to recognise is the propensity to use the feelings of  particular emotions as the litmus test for immorality or illegality and not the relevant dangers to individuals and the general community that come as a result of the said actions. Violence in sport is condoned but it is tightly ring-fenced. In the same manner, slimy substances elicit feelings of disgust. Examples such as these serve to illustrate that there is no necessary correlation between specific actions and the feelings they produce in others. But because the feelings are so commonly felt as a result of immoral actions, the feelings themselves act as flags for immorality. Hence, people will draw the false conclusion that, because they feel a certain way, an immoral act is being perpetrated. Chances are that they are correct but it is not necessarily true. 
        I can also make the argument that because homosexual activity was such a big deal in ancient times and is now, the conclusion that Moseic law and the morality behind it were developed as a direct result of the emotional reactions to their infraction and not based on an objective evaluation of thier potential damage to society. A Hobbesian agreement of any kind would be better than the so-called state of nature
        As outlined above, the moral code derived from scripture is an admixture of two sensibilities: a sense of justice and a sense of cleanliness. The first of these is, without a doubt, well established with most of this group of laws having to do with reparations and punishments for specific offences against persons or their property. The second, although not frequently recognized, is clear from the common theme of proper procedures for ceremonial washing, food preparation, and priestly inspection regarding disease. The two groups combine to form a code that regulates behaviour both prohibitively and prescriptively. Thus, both injustice and contagion are minimised. 
        The minimising of injustice and contagion are designed to minimise fear in community and, thereby build trust, And, by building trust, the community can develop a single purpose in the face of outside threats. Therefore, if infractions of the stated laws occur, fear is raised. But the emotions attendant to the raising of fear differ from one infraction to another. For infractions having to do with harm to self or property one’s attendant emotion is anger. For infractions having to do with health and cleanliness one’s attendant emotion is disgust, the difference between the two being whether a perpetrator can be identified.
        Strangely, some see no difference between injustice and disgust. Are these people just unable to tell the difference or are the two concepts/feelings so intertwined that they ought to be treated as the same thing? Perhaps one contains the other. Certainly, one can be disgusted with injustice but feelings of injustice over disgusting things is a stretch. But this observation brings up a question concerning the types of things injustice and disgust are. Are they from one category? Is it even valid to compare the two? The sense of injustice has a much more cerebral feel to it. It’s almost academic. It’s certainly more objective when speaking about it generally. Disgust, on the other hand, has a definite guttural quality to it. Perhaps, then, the sense of injustice and the sense of disgust are reactions from different parts of the brain. Whatever the origins of each, it is obvious that the more cerebral sense of injustice is a construct based on social norms and not on physiological changes in the body.



        Conclusion

        My point may be illustrated by comparing the unjust actions toward a person and doing the same injustice to a dead person, what we call the desecration of a body. One reacts with anger towards the former and disgust with the latter. The difference between the two is that the latter is largely an aesthetic infraction. For this reason I believe that the traditional view expressed by the HSR is based on aesthetics and aesthetic taste and not on any sense of justice or injustice. It is based on feelings of a sense of cleanliness not safety.
        Not only should the HSR, and its defense of a traditional deontological moral structure, be questioned as desperately needing an update, the premise that homosexual behaviour is considered anathema is based not on moral grounds but, instead, on.aesthetic grounds. From the position that a moral code is a social construct and not just a fiat declaration, the HSR position though well defended biblically is not defensible creationally. The creator
