    <p>Day three, 3:56 pm. Went on a trip today to the Brazeau dam.</p>
    <p>Nice country out there.</p>
    <br>
    <P>I've been tempted by all sorts of different business ideas today.</P>
    <p>This is interesting, not only on a psychological result of having decided on a course of action, but also because it shows all the wealth of the opportunities out there.</p>
    <p>I think I'm looking people who want to sell their business.</p>
    <p>I'looking for people who want to sell their KM business.</p>
    <p>In the mean time, I'm building a KM business by searching for business succesion candidates.</p>
    <p>Run with this thing already!</p>
    <P>But I'm afraid to commit.</P>
    <p>My areas of expertise will naturally carry this forward in very unexpected ways.</p>
    <p>Maybe I should write about it.</p>
