    <p>Day 4, 10:52. This morning I realised a fundamental contradiction:</p>
    <p>I was committing myself to a new course of action and abandonning what I had committed to before.</p>
    <p>What this shows me is that I am extremely susceptable to others' assessment of what I should be doing.</p>
    <p>I have been working on coding for three years and then one video tells me to commit to something if I want to become rich.</p>
    <p>So, what did I do?</p>
    <p>I dropped what I have been doing and committed to KM.</p>
    <p>Am I mad?</p>
    <p>No!</p>
    <p>Witness the rise of the philosophers, the rebirth of Christian philosophy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Day 4, 11:48. Remember that KM is a funding model.</p>
    <p>Accounting/Bookkeeping/Whatever is the way I keep my project afloat.</p>
