    <p>Day4, 10:36. I seem to have settled down a bit from this afternoon's realisation.</p>
    <p>I'm still not sure how I can salvage a direction from this crisis but I will start with a good meditation.</p>
    <p>I do not know why I get sucked in by these assholes but I do.</p>
    <p>One take away from this is I know that I get sold on the idea of instant or guaranteed wealth.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So, just take it easy. Lay low on the accounting thing, and focus on the goals you've set for yourself before.</p>
    <p>They were good goals.</p>
